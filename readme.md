# About this repository

This is part of a blog post series published on [worksystems.design](https://worksystems.design/blog/).

Starting with systems topology diagrams using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), I will also explore means to visualize flight routes, events and activities, and other aspects of Flight Levels systems.

* More about Flight Levels: [flightlevels.io](https://flightlevels.io/).
